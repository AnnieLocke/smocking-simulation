Concrete Form[ing]work workshop 
University of Malaga 
December 2020

This is a Grasshopper 3D and Rhino file provided to an online Masters student workshop in 2020. 

These files can be used to simulate arrow smocking patterns from the "smocking pattern generation" script. 

You may also need to download some grasshopper plugins to open the file. 

The script sections are split with vertical lines. 

The file has multiple Kangaroo 2 solvers in it, and it is important to run each solver before moving onto the next. 

Items grouped in CYAN are meant for previewing, components in RED are meant for user-interaction/input (play button on a solver, adjustment of sliders, etc.)

Try it out, and happy smocking!
